<b>Install script for Intrepid Studios Launcher in Lutris.</b>

Information:
============
Since the release of GE-Proton10-1 the Steam hook isn't needed anymore and the game can be started with the "Launch Game" button in the Intrepid Studios Launcher like on Windows. The manual below was updated accordingly.


What you need, to use this installation method:
==============================================
- Linux system (e.g. Nobara Linux, Fedora, Arch Linux, etc. <b>and avoid Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu, etc., as these can cause some problems</b>)
- Lutris installed
- GE-Proton10-1 installed (To comfortably install and keep up to date GE-Proton, I recommand to use the application 'ProtonPlus')

How to install Intrepid Launcher and Ashes of Creation:
=======================================================
1. Download the YAML file (<a href="https://github.com/F0rce1991/Ashes-of-Creation-Lutris-YAML/raw/refs/heads/main/Ashes-of-Creation.yaml">Ashes-of-Creation.yaml</a>)
2. Open Lutris
3. Click the + symbol in the upper left corner
4. Select the installation method with YAML file
5. Click ... in the 'Script file' field and select the previously downloaded YAML file
6. Click the install buttons
7. Select the install path. The options below can be set as desired.
8. Leave everything as is and click the install button again
9. Wait for the installation to complete (this may take a few minutes)
10. When the Intrepid Studios Launcher installation window pops up you can leave everything as is and just start the installation
11. Once the installation of Intrepid Studios Launcher is done you can decide if you wanna start it right away. Nonetheless it is recommanded to uncheck the box and first finish the installation in Lutris.
12. Once the installation is complete in Lutris, you can start Intrepid Studios Launcher from the Lutris library
13. Log in to your Intrepid Studios Account and wait for the download of the game to finish
14. Start the game with the "Launch Game" button in the Intrepid Studios Launcher

For comfort reasons I recommand to create a Desktop Shortcut for the game. You can do so by right clicking on 'Ashes of Creation' entry in Lutris and select the corresponding option from dropdown menu.

<b>Have Fun!</b>
